I want to use the database to track the fate of each aircraft carrier, including whether it was sunk or decommissioned as well as the date this occurred.
I want to be able to get a list of key battles in which a specific aircraft carrier participated.
I want to look up which commanders were in charge of specific aircraft carriers during key battles.
